# Notes
## Git

Git is a free open-source **version control system**, that tracks changes in computer files – code and saves them in a database called repository (projects).

* Distributed VCS: Coordinates work between multiple developers 
  * Each developer has a copy of the project and its history locally and can synchronize it with the other developers
  * Many developers can work on the same project without being on the same network
* Shows and keeps track of history of the code and takes snapshots by using a “commit”-command 
  * who made what changes when and why
  * reverts to previous versions of code at anytime
* Work on local repo and upload it on remote repo (GitHub, BitBucket etc.)

### Important terms

*	**Directory** - Folder
* **Terminal/Command line** - interface where you can type in text commands
  *	navigate around files and folders
  * create files

*	**cd** - change directory (=navigate between folder in the system)
*	**Code Editor** - place to write code (e.g.: Word Processor for writing code)
*	**Repository (repo)** - project, or the folder/place where your folder is kept
*	**GitHub** - a website where you host/upload all your repos online

### Git Commands

* **init** - initialize local Git repository – creates a (dot)git folder
* **clone** - bring a repo that is hosted online (e.g.: GitHub) into a folder on your local machine
*	**add** - track your files and changes in Git
*	**status** - checks status of your directory
*	**commit** - saves your files in Git
*	**push** - upload Git commits to remote repo. Like GitHub
